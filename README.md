# Interim challenges

## Today I wrote code for the challenges.

### Easiest part was:
Inserting the Scanners and Strings were the most simplest things to code for as I've learnt the piece of code off by heart.
#### Most difficult part was:
Remembering how to use the "if" and "else" statements effectively and correctly on a piece of code.

##### The grade I would like to achive at the end of summer 2018 is an A++
